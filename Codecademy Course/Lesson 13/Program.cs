        //public ===> the method could be called outside the program class
        //static ===> the method is called from the class name: Program.Main()
        //void ===> the method returns nothing
        //string[] args ===> the method has one parameter named args, which is an array of strings

        //To run a C# file from the cmd:
        //dotnet run

        //To set values to the args array:
        //dotnet run Mohamed Salah Liverpool
        //now the args contain: {"Mohamed", "Salah", "Liverpool"}
